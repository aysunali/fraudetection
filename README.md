# Fraud Detection On Credit Card Transactions

This project aims to develop a Machine learning algorithm that classifies fraud bank transactions. It is a continuation of another project that includes an exploration of 2 bank transactions datasets which helped in the feature selection and feature engineering stages. The results from the previous project are in the *Data Exploration* section of the notebook.
